# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
*I feel relatively confident with `each` so far! I was somewhat familiar with the concept of iteration and this method going in, so this was a good refresher for the concept and good practice actually articulating what the code is doing (rather than just being able to write it from a tutorial...).*

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? *It felt really good to be pulling things together from prior lessons, background knowledge, and new research - lots of Googling here! Most of my struggle was productive. I used Ruby-Docs to look up a few methods I wasn't familiar with like `reverse` and went back to the directions for a previous assignment when I briefly forgot how to clone a repo.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*At this point, I feel good about moving forward. I think I can do with more practice describing how code works in technical terms, which is something I will do through future video assignments and in my pairing work tomorrow. I'd also like to push myself to write or say aloud the descriptions of what the example code blocks are doing in our lessons, rather than just reading them and thinking I understand them silently in my own head.*

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*Lots and lots of questions about what else we can do with `each` and what the other iterative methods are in Ruby! I am also curious about combining conditional logic and iteration, like we started to do here, and how this will work syntactically as we get to more complicated examples.*
